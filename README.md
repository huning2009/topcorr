# TopCorr

A small Python library for constructing filtered correlation networks

## Getting Started

The package requires networkx and numpy. Scikit-learn is used in some of the examples to generate correlation matrices.

It can be installed using pip:

pip install topcorr

An example for creating a PMFG
```
import topcorr
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_spd_matrix

p = 50
n = 200
C = make_spd_matrix(p)
X = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(p), C, n)
corr = np.corrcoef(X.T)

pmfg_G = topcorr.pmfg(corr)
```

The other methods work in much the same way (bar thresholding) - put in a correlation matrix and
it will return a networkx graph.

There are some issues with the TMFG implementation right now - it doesn't always seem to pass the
tests, so be aware when using it.

## Testing

If you're interested in running the tests they can be found in the /tests/ folder and are to
be run with nose2. 

For the TMFG the authors have provided an R implementation, so we test against that. This requires
that you install rpy2 and the NetworkToolbox package. The other tests will also require the installation
of sklearn.
